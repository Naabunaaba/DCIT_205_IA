        The Information Technology age is centered around Computer Science, which is crucial for society to fully benefit from the advantages of Information Technology and make rapid economic progress. Computer Science involves the study and development of applications that allow for everyday use of computers, the software systems that support these applications, and the means and methods used to produce both applications and systems that behave reliably, correctly, and ethically. Computer programming is at the heart of Computer Science, and employers who hire Computer Scientists expect adept programmers <br /> <br /> with knowledge of current techniques and tools and the ability to apply sound engineering principles to the development, construction, and maintenance of computer programs. The Department offers two undergraduate degree programs, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major and Major-Minor, as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. The range of courses available in the department and the skills acquired by students enable them to find employment in many diverse fields of the economy and prepare graduates for the computing industry, working in a project team (or research and development team), and to enable the graduate to bring specialist skills to that team. The course also provides the platform for further study or research through exposure to established and emerging technologies and methods, and to active fields of research in Computer Science.</p>
